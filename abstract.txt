This paper explores a novel dataset on daily arrivals and departures of a small aerodrome in Santiago de Chile, one of the most unequal countries in the world. It particularly shows how elites were able to bypass lockdown policies aimed to restrict mobility during the pandemic using a small aerodrome located in the heart of the richest municipalities in Santiago. While most Chileans were under heavy lockdown policies, political elites were able to travel within the country to their vacation houses and cottages. While the Chilean state deployed with some degree of success both the army and police members throughout its territory, it was not able to control air traffic (strictly used by the elites). These findings go in line with recent literature that not only shows that the concept of state capacity is not a monolithic one (i.e., states can have high state capacity in some areas, but weak in others) but also with with the idea that states deliberately incur in the ``politics of weakness.'' In fact, this paper shows how local authorities faced high political pressures to systematically ignore overseeing traffic control policies during the pandemic. The paper exploits a novel dataset, time-series methods, regression discontinuity designs and key informant interviews.
